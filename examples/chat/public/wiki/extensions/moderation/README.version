1) Version has the following format: x.y.z, e.g. 1.0.35.
2) Version is updated after any change in the PHP code, SQL, CSS/JS or i18n.
3) Version is not updated after changes in testsuite and documentation.
4) Both extension.json (for MW1.25+) and legacy Moderation.php must be updated.

Note: if some feature is being developed in a different Git branch
(e.g. "some-feature1"), then you need to update version number only once -
just before this branch is merged into master.
