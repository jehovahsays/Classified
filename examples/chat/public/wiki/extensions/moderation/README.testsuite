Extension:Moderation has an automated testsuite.

== What is the automated testsuite? ==

This is a collection of tests which check operability of Moderation extension.

By running those tests, we can check if some modification to Moderation or to
the MediaWiki core itself (e.g. when new version of MediaWiki is released)
causes a regression (side effect bug).

The tests of Moderation are focused on "black box" testing,
meaning that instead of checking internal database only,
we check the exact behavior that real users face by duplicating their actions
and looking at the results through the user interface
and parts of MediaWiki API not related to Moderation.

== Invocation ==

WARNING: THIS TEST DOESN'T PRESERVE EXISTING DATABASE. EVERYTHING IS DELETED.

1) Install PHPunit.

2) Go into the MediaWiki directory.

3) Run the following command:

for i in extensions/Moderation/tests/phpunit/*.php; do tests/phpunit/phpunit.php $i; done

For MediaWiki 1.28+ you can use a shorter command:

tests/phpunit/phpunit.php extensions/Moderation

== Writing new tests ==

File [tests/ModerationTestsuite.php] is the general framework
for blackbox testing of Extension:Moderation.

It provides the following:

1) methods to access the MediaWiki API (NOT via internal invocation).

2) automated creation of test users and clean test environment.

3) methods to fetch Special:Moderation, parse it into the array of entries
(ModerationTestsuiteEntry) and compare two snapshots of Special:Moderation.
