This is a list of manual tests (VisualEditor and MobileFrontend support).
===============================================================================

JavaScript API-based editors are rather difficult to test automatically.
Until we implement Selenium-based tests, functionality MUST be tested manually.

===============================================================================
A. Tested extensions, tested MediaWiki versions.

The following combinations must be tested:
1) VisualEditor + MediaWiki 1.27 (LTS)
2) MobileFrontend + MediaWiki 1.27 (LTS)
3) MobileFrontend + MediaWiki 1.23 (old LTS)

There is no need to test VisualEditor with MediaWiki 1.23,
because VisualEditor wasn't quite ready at that time when 1.23 was used.

===============================================================================
B. Preparing wiki for the test.

1) Ensure that MobileFrontend/VisualEditor work without Extension:Moderation.
2) Create an article with at least 4 sections (from automoderated account).
3a) Logout.
(or)
3b) Login as non-automoderated user.

Note: MobileFrontend for MediaWiki 1.23 doesn't support anonymous editing.

===============================================================================
C. What to test.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Edit the entire page (modify the text). Specify non-blank edit summary.

Note: MobileFrontend editor only edits one section.
Try Edit button on top of the article (which edits section #0) instead.

1.1. CHECK: editor didn't show any errors.
1.2. CHECK: notification "your edit was queued for moderation" appeared.
1.3. CHECK: default (wrong) notification "your edit was saved" was NOT shown.
1.4. CHECK: (VisualEditor only) the article hasn't become empty after editing.
1.5. CHECK: notification doesn't auto-hide after several seconds.
1.6. CHECK: edit link inside the notification has correct URL.
1.7. CHECK: notification disappears when you click on it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Open the edit form again.

2.1. CHECK: your text from the edit you just made has appeared in textarea.
2.2. CHECK: your edit summary didn't disappear.

Note: for MobileFrontend, /* Section */ part may be removed from summary.
This is a correct behavior, as MobileFrontend adds this to summary itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Edit section #0 (via the "Edit" link near the section header).

Repeat checks 1.1-2.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Edit another section (any one of them will do).

Repeat checks 1.1-2.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. (VisualEditor only) Click "Edit source" tab, then return to "Edit" tab.

Repeat check 2.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. (MobileFrontend only) Edit several different sections.

6.1. CHECK: summary doesn't look like "/* Section 3 */ /* Section 1 */ [...]".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall:

Make sure that no errors/warnings appear in the browser console
(except those which appear even without Extension:Moderation).
