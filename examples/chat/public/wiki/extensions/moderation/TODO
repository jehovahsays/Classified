TODO:

Medium-prio:
* (testsuite) Provide ~100% automated test coverage of all functionality.

Low-prio:
* (feature) Intercept renaming of pages.
* (feature) Provide flexible handling of zero edits, for example suppress if
	there is no edit comment, mark them with "is zero edit" flag viewable
	to the moderator, add an option (disabled by default) to suppress
	zero edits completely, etc.
* (interface) For non-automoderated users: show a message on their
	Special:Contributions ensuring them that their edits will
	appear there when they are approved.
* (feature) Temporarily allow everyone to skip moderation on one specific page.
	If some page is becoming popular amongst many new editors (e.g. fans of
	some film are collectively writing about it), it makes sence to disable
	moderation on it, because users will monitor the new changes themselves,
	and administrator won't have to manually merge edit conflicts.
	This mode should be time-limited, like page protections,
	e.g. "Admin1 allowed unmoderated edits on Page2 for the next 3 days".
	There shouldn't be an "indefinite" duration (or even >1 week), because
	we don't want vandals to edit a bunch of such pages in a year or two.


Background-prio (may not be needed):
* (feature) Post factum elimination of duplicate anonymous edits (e.g. when one
	of those edits is preloaded by the user).
* (interface) Ask "Really approve all edits from <user>?" when
	clicking "Approve all" (NOT via JavaScript).
* (interface) For each folder, display the number of new entries there
	in the last day and week.
* (interface) After the actions like Approve return to the moderation page,
	displaying the message like "Approved N edits" in the page header.
* (feature) Support uploads via API.

Tests to implement:
- use Selenium to test ajaxhook (VisualEditor/MobileFrontend support)
